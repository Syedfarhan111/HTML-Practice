    <h1>Leaders</h1>

    <h3>1. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p> <mark> The first prime Minister of India</mark> ruled a chaotic newborn country right from its independence in
        1947 until his
        death in 1964. Nehru’s legacy is that of an extremely liberal, socialist and secular leader, who under the
        apprenticeship of Mahatma Gandhi, firmly put India on the course in which it runs today. Nehru was a man of
        letters and is also credited with creating the Planning Commission of India.</p><br><br>

    <h3>2. B. R. Ambedkar</h3>

    <p>One of the greatest personalities ever born in India, <mark>Ambedkar was a jurist, political leader, philosopher,
            anthropologist, historian, revolutionary, writer and much more</mark>. He was a revolutionary leader and
        held forth on
        his views even if they went against the popular grain. He also revived Buddhism in India, a legacy still seen in
        Dalit communities, who’s cause Ambedkar championed throughout his life. Ambedkar is also known as the Father of
        the Indian Constitution, on behalf of which the nation celebrated Republic Day.</p>


    <h3>3. Atal Behari Vajpayee</h3>
    <p>The recipient of the Padma Vibhushan in 1992,<mark> he is one of the most respected political leaders in India’s
            history.</mark> The only prime minister to serve a full term outside the Congree Party, Vajpayee was known
        to be a
        liberal within the BJP, a party with extreme right views. He fearlessly led the nuclear tests in</p>

    <h3>4. Lal Bahadur Shastri</h3>
    <p><mark> the boots of Jawaharlal Nehru was never going to be an easy task,</mark> but Lal Bahadur Shastri did just
        that,
        and with elan. He gave India a slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisaan’ and worked extensively for farmer sector in India
        in continuation of Nehru’s socialist policies. India’s decisive victory in the war against Pakistan in 1965
        while he was Prime Minister elevated the country’s mood after its defeat to China earlier and turned him into a
        hero to cherish forever.</p>


    <h3>5. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h3>
    <p><mark>India was not inherited as a whole piece of land upon Independence</mark>. It was divided into princely
        states whose
        leaders demanded uncontrolled privileges or sought to remain as neutral territories. Dealing with each of them
        sternly and firmly earned Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the sobriquet of India’s Iron Man. He also established the
        civil services division in Indian administration.</p>
